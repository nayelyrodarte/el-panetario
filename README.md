### El Panetario

## Installation

1. Run `yarn` or `yarn i` to install all packages.
2. Update the necessary env variables, as follows:

`NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=ID_GOES_HERE`
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET="production"`
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION="2024-04-03"`

3. Run `yarn dev` to start the local environment.

## Sanity Studio

Sanity Studio is embedded into the app. To run it, just navigate to `/studio`.

## Types

Types should be manually autogenerated after the app's GROQ queries. In order to autogenerate, run: `yarn schema` and once it's done, run `yarn typegen`. This will update the sanity.types.ts file, making the types available to export when needed.
